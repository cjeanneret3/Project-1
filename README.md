# Project-1
In this project we were tasked with helping UNMD to go through a set of air quality data throughout the state of Nebraska using various codes to organize and better view the data. The data was grouped into different subsets and code was used to find certain data points for each subset including minimums, maximums, means, and medians. We were also able to filter through the data to find only high or low temperatures as well as high and low altitudes. Using those filters makes it much easier to determine connections between different data points to gather useful information.
